```

### Prerequisites

* Your C compilation environment
* [Make (software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))

### Installing

Add content of malloc directory in the fae directory if memory management functions are allowed before creating the lib.
Replace h files and makefile.
```sh
cp malloc/* fae/*
```

Source code is stored in fae directory, use included makefile to compile the library :
```sh
cd fae
make
```

You can now use the libfae.a generated in your projects.
